    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Currently working as an ID Developer at Money Forward, Tokyo. I build and maintain secure authentication and authorization systems using OAuth2.0, OpenID, Passkeys and SAML SSO. I also lead development on key microservices that support B2B offerings, handling everything from implementation to deployment, infrastructure, and monitoring.
      <br />
      <br />
      Alongside that, Iâ€™ve been involved in DevOps and some SRE-related improvements, including security strengthening, AWS, and performance tuning. Iâ€™m especially interested in authentication, authorization, and SSO and enjoy working on systems where security and user experience go hand in hand.
